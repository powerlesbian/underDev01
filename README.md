I used the gigichaoIsAwesome API

What design decisions did you make? 

I kept is clean and simple as possible as that seems to be the trend these days


Reflecting on the process: 
What did you find challenging?

The coding part.  The still unfamiliar syntax and pinata of curly braces, brackets and square brackets that pepper the screen. 

What did you enjoy? 

I enjoyed exploring all the API resources and understanding how to use them.

What do you want to learn more about?

I want to learn more about REST APIs and how to use them.
